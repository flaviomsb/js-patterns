##  <a href="https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/decorator" target="_blank">Decorator Pattern</a>

The decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

## Motivation

- Augment an object with additional functionality
- Prevent rewriting of existing code (open close principle)
- Keep the new functionality separate (single responsibility principle)
