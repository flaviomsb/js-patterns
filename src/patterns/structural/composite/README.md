## Composite Pattern

The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object.

## Motivation

- A part-whole hierarchy should be represented so that clients can treat part and whole objects uniformly
- A part-whole hierarchy should be represented as tree structure
