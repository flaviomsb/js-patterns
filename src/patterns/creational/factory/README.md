## <a href="https://www.patterns.dev/posts/factory-pattern/" target="_blank">Factory Pattern</a>

The Factory pattern is about implementing a component responsible for the wholesale creation of objects. \
Such component could either be achieved via a factory method or a total separate class known as factory class.

## Motivation

- Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
- Wholesale object creation (unlike Builder pattern)
