## <a href="https://www.patterns.dev/posts/singleton-pattern/" target="_blank">Singleton Pattern</a>

Singletons are classes which can be instantiated once, and can be accessed globally.

## Motivation

- Singletons are useful in situations where system-wide actions need to be coordinated from a single central place
- Potentially save memory space by restricting the instantiation of just one instance
