## <a href="https://www.sohamkamani.com/javascript/builder-pattern/" target="_blank">Builder Pattern</a>

The Builder pattern allows a piecewise construction of a complex object. It provides an API for constructing an object \
step-by-step while hiding its implementation details from the client entirely.

## Motivation

- Simplify client code that creates complex objects
- When an object is not simple enough in order to be created with a single initializer call
