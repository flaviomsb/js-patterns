##  <a href="https://www.patterns.dev/posts/observer-pattern/" target="_blank">Observer Pattern</a>

The Observer pattern is an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system

## Motivation

- Using the observer pattern is a great way to enforce separation of concerns and the single-responsiblity principle
- Observer objects arenâ€™t tightly coupled to the observable object, and can be (de)coupled at any time
