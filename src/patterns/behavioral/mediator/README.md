##  <a href="https://www.patterns.dev/posts/mediator-pattern/" target="_blank">Mediator Pattern</a>

The Mediator pattern is a component that facilitates communication between other components without them \
necessarily being aware of each other or having direct access to each other

## Motivation

- Tight coupling between a set of interacting objects should be avoided
- It should be possible to change the interaction between a set of objects independently
