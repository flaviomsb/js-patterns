##  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern" target="_blank">Memento Pattern</a>

The Memento pattern is a token / handle representing the system state

## Motivation

- The internal state of an object should be saved externally so that the object can be restored to this state later
- The object's encapsulation must not be violated
